# VKD3D-Proton

VKD3D-Proton is a fork of VKD3D, which aims to implement the full Direct3D 12 API on top of Vulkan.
The project serves as the development effort for Direct3D 12 support in [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton).

## Upstream

The original project is available at [WineHQ](https://source.winehq.org/git/vkd3d.git/).

## Priorities

Performance and compatibility are important targets, at the expense of compatibility with older drivers and systems.
Modern Vulkan extensions and features are aggressively made use of to improve performance and compatibility.
It is recommended to use the very latest drivers you can get your hands on for the best experience.
Backwards compatibility with the vkd3d standalone API is not a goal of this project.

## Cloning the repo

To clone the repo you should run:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton
```
in order to pull in all the submodules which are needed for building.

## Building VKD3D

### Requirements:
- [wine](https://www.winehq.org/) (for `widl`) [for native builds]
  - On Windows this may be substituted for [Strawberry Perl](http://strawberryperl.com/) as it ships `widl` and is easy to find and install -- although this dependency may be eliminated in the future.
- [Meson](http://mesonbuild.com/) build system (at least version 0.51)
- [glslang](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang) compiler
- [Mingw-w64](http://mingw-w64.org/) compiler, headers and tools (at least version 7.0) [for cross-builds for d3d12.dll which are default]

### Building:
#### The simple way
Inside the VKD3D directory, run:
```
./package-release.sh master /your/target/directory --no-package
```

This will create a folder `vkd3d-master` in `/your/target/directory`, which contains both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of VKD3D, which can be set up in the same way as the release versions as noted above.

If you want to build natively (ie. for `libvkd3d.so`), pass `--native` to the build script. This option will make it build using your system's compilers.

In order to preserve the build directories for development, pass `--dev-build` to the script. This option implies `--no-package`. After making changes to the source code, you can then do the following to rebuild VKD3D:
```
# change to build.86 for 32-bit
cd /your/target/directory/build.64
ninja install
```

#### Compiling manually (cross for d3d12.dll, default)
```
# 64-bit build.
meson --cross-file build-win64.txt -Denable_standalone_d3d12=True --buildtype release --prefix /your/vkd3d/directory build.64
cd build.64
ninja install

# 32-bit build
meson --cross-file build-win32.txt -Denable_standalone_d3d12=True  --buildtype release --prefix /your/vkd3d/directory build.86
cd build.86
ninja install
```

#### Compiling manually (native)
```
# 64-bit build.
meson --buildtype release --prefix /your/vkd3d/directory build.64
cd build.64
ninja install

# 32-bit build
meson --cross-file x86-linux-gnu --buildtype release --prefix /your/vkd3d/directory build.86
cd build.86
ninja install
```

## Using VKD3D

VKD3D can be used by projects that target Direct3D 12 as a drop-in replacement
at build-time with some modest source modifications.

If VKD3D is available when building Wine, then Wine will use it to support
Direct3D 12 applications.

## Environment variables

Most of the environment variables used by VKD3D are for debugging purposes. The
environment variables are not considered a part of API and might be changed or
removed in the future versions of VKD3D.

Some of debug variables are lists of elements. Elements must be separated by
commas or semicolons.

 - `VKD3D_CONFIG` - a list of options that change the behavior of libvkd3d.
    - vk_debug - enables Vulkan debug extensions and loads validation layer.
 - `VKD3D_DEBUG` - controls the debug level for log messages produced by
   libvkd3d. Accepts the following values: none, err, fixme, warn, trace.
 - `VKD3D_SHADER_DEBUG` - controls the debug level for log messages produced by
   libvkd3d-shader. See `VKD3D_DEBUG` for accepted values.
 - `VKD3D_LOG_FILE` - If set, redirects `VKD3D_DEBUG` logging output to a file instead.
 - `VKD3D_VULKAN_DEVICE` - a zero-based device index. Use to force the selected
   Vulkan device.
 - `VKD3D_DISABLE_EXTENSIONS` - a list of Vulkan extensions that libvkd3d should
   not use even if available.
 - `VKD3D_TEST_DEBUG` - enables additional debug messages in tests. Set to 0, 1
   or 2.
 - `VKD3D_TEST_FILTER` - a filter string. Only the tests whose names matches the
   filter string will be run, e.g. `VKD3D_TEST_FILTER=clear_render_target`.
   Useful for debugging or developing new tests.
 - `VKD3D_TEST_PLATFORM` - can be set to "wine", "windows" or "other". The test
   platform controls the behavior of todo(), todo_if(), bug_if() and broken()
   conditions in tests.
 - `VKD3D_TEST_BUG` - set to 0 to disable bug_if() conditions in tests.
 - `VKD3D_PROFILE_PATH` - If profiling is enabled in the build, a profiling block is
   emitted to `${VKD3D_PROFILE_PATH}.${pid}`.

## CPU profiling (development)

Pass `-Denable_profiling=true` to Meson to enable a profiled build. With a profiled build, use `VKD3D_PROFILE_PATH` environment variable.
The profiling dumps out a binary blob which can be analyzed with `programs/vkd3d-profile.py`.
The profile is a trivial system which records number of iterations and total ticks (ns) spent.
It is easy to instrument parts of code you are working on optimizing.

## Advanced shader debugging

These features are only meant to be used by vkd3d-proton developers. For any builtin RenderDoc related functionality
pass `-Denable_renderdoc=true` to Meson.

 - `VKD3D_SHADER_DUMP_PATH` - path where shader bytecode is dumped.
   Bytecode is dumped in format of `$hash.{spv,dxbc,dxil}`.
 - `VKD3D_SHADER_OVERRIDE` - path to where overridden shaders can be found.
   If application is creating a pipeline with `$hash` and `$VKD3D_SHADER_OVERRIDE/$hash.spv` exists,
   that SPIR-V file will be used instead.
 - `VKD3D_AUTO_CAPTURE_SHADER` - If this is set to a shader hash, and the RenderDoc layer is enabled,
 vkd3d-proton will automatically make a capture when a specific shader is encountered.
 - `VKD3D_AUTO_CAPTURE_COUNTS` - A comma-separated list of indices. This can be used to control which queue submissions to capture.
 E.g., use `VKD3D_AUTO_CAPTURE_COUNTS=0,4,10` to capture the 0th (first submission), 4th and 10th submissions which are candidates for capturing.

 If only `VKD3D_AUTO_CAPTURE_COUNTS` is set, any queue submission is considered for capturing.
 If only `VKD3D_AUTO_CAPTURE_SHADER` is set, `VKD3D_AUTO_CAPTURE_COUNTS` is considered to be equal to `"0"`, i.e. a capture is only
 made on first encounter with the target shader.
 If both are set, the capture counter is only incremented and considered when a submission contains the use of the target shader.
